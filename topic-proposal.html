        <h2 class="pagetitle">Topic Proposal</h2>

        <div class="block">
            <p><b>Chosen Topic:</b> Electronic medical records, and their impact on efficiency and privacy.</p>
            <p>In the area of healthcare & medicine, a common point of friction is record-keeping. If a patient frequents multiple practices or physicians, the medical history of that patient will have to be re-conveyed to each new provider. Electronic medical health records (EMRs) allow for healthcare professionals to record a patient's medical information electronically in a central database, and digitally share the patient's file across a network of connected providers, such as across a national healthcare system.</p>
            <p>EMRs are vital for the modern-day health care system. They provide support for various areas of the medical field by improving efficiency and patient privacy. EMRs allow healthcare professionals to provide more focus on patient care, as they reduce the time that is spent on manually entering documentations, also reducing the risk for errors such as medication and duplicate errors caused by manual data entry.</p>
            <p>Patient security and privacy is critical, where producing medical information of patients electronically poses the risks of data breaches compared to the traditional paper method. In the event of a significant data breach occurring, it can seriously affect the efficiency of medical professionals providing the best care for their patients, which would not be seen with the use of the traditional method of displaying medical information.</p>
