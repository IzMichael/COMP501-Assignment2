            <p>This mock-up site is intended to support your team project so you can take this as a set of files and as a starting point and adapt it to your preference. It is built on a W3C site tutorial so does not claim to be flash, but now has an image, [of a paper we wrote a while back on CSED4G (Computing Education for the Social Good)]</p>
            <p>The site is not particularly well presented, but as the site uses HTML and has been styled with CSS it can be regarded as a <em>"minimum viable product"</em> for the purposes of this project... It has some default links, which you can take as a start for your site structure. The <em>Process Support</em> Links provides guidance which will be needed for presenting your final project.</p>
